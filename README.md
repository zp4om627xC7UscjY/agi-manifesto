First they invented a car. Then they decided that the only way to use the car was driving backwards and forwards the same single road. The engine of this car is called the transformer model architecture, and the car itself is referred to as large language model. Marvin Minsky would probably have asked: But what about road networks?

In the quest for higher intelligence, we could call network nodes in a directed graph as a "multiagent" and each of the nodes an "agent."

Also, we could suppose that this network evolves, somehow, autonomously over "time" and that we may only define the initial configuration; self-modification has power.

Also, we could define that each node shall be a single LLM instances with its own configuration.

Also, we can give each node that have interesting initial configuration in the form of model of choice and temprature, prompt and programming interfaces it can acces.

Also, we could allow the agents to modify their own configurations over other agents and represent these connections with the arrows of the directes graph.

I claim that it is possible build an artifical general intelligence with this.

The two primary problems seem to be:

1) That the amount of different possible combinations of directed graphs grows faster than exponentially as the number of nodes increases.

Solution: Multiagent Systems Explorer, a program for systematic search of more intelligent multiagents: so that anyone can explore the combinatorial space; store results; and share them.

2) That a timing scheme is required to synchronize the multiagent system as whole. Essentially a messaging or time-sharing problem. Possibly solved.

Solution: Publish this and let others to invent the best timing schemes
